    <h2>A little introduction to the Northern Beaches</h2>
    <p>
      The Northern Beaches is a region within Northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, near the Pacific coast.<br>
      This area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to Middle Harbour and north to the entrance of Broken Bay.<br>
      The area was formerly inhabited by the Garigal or Caregal people in a region known as Guringai country.<br>
      The Northern Beaches district is governed on a local level by the Northern Beaches Council, which was formed in May 2016 from Warringah Council (est. 1906), Manly Council (est. 1877), and Pittwater Council (est. 1992).<br>
